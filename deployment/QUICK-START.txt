║  LEARNTOBOT - QUICK DEPLOYMENT TO 100+ LAPTOPS                      ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

WHAT THIS DOES:
---------------
Installs protocol handlers on all student laptops so files and folders
open automatically when clicked (no copy-paste needed).


PREREQUISITES:
--------------
✓ All laptops powered ON and on same network
✓ You have admin credentials for the laptops
✓ PowerShell remoting enabled (see guide if not)


QUICK STEPS:
------------

1. CREATE COMPUTER LIST
   - Rename: computers-SAMPLE.txt → computers.txt
   - Add all laptop names/IPs (one per line)

2. TEST ON A FEW COMPUTERS FIRST
   - Edit computers.txt to include only 2-3 computers
   - Run deployment (see step 3)
   - Verify it works before doing all 100

3. RUN DEPLOYMENT
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Navigate to this folder
   - Run: .\Deploy-ProtocolHandlers.ps1
   - Enter admin credentials when prompted
   - Press Y to confirm
   - Wait for completion (~30 seconds per computer)

4. CHECK RESULTS
   - Review the summary shown on screen
   - Check the CSV file for detailed results
   - Test on a few deployed computers


TESTING:
--------
On deployed computer:
→ Open: http://[SERVER-IP]:3000/student-files.html
→ Click "Open in Explorer" on a folder
→ Folder should open in Windows Explorer
→ Click any file
→ File should open with default program


IF IT DOESN'T WORK:
-------------------
Most common issue: PowerShell remoting not enabled

Solution: On each laptop, run PowerShell as Admin:
  Enable-PSRemoting -Force

See REMOTE-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md for full troubleshooting.


ALTERNATIVE (NO INSTALLATION NEEDED):
--------------------------------------
If PowerShell remoting is too complicated, you can skip installation:
→ Students click "Open in Explorer"
→ Path is automatically copied
→ They paste (Ctrl+V) into Windows Explorer
→ Works on all 100 laptops immediately, no setup required
